# Robotarium Implementation

This is the code for the sampling-based controller and SOS-based controller implemented on a differential drive robot in the Robotarium. To execute the code, please follow the instructions below:
  
* Run the init.m file
* Go to the "Sampling-based Controller" folder to run the sampling based framework, or the "SOS-based Controller" folder to run the SOS-based framework
* Run the "main.m" file for the respective methods

NOTE: The SOS controller code requires SOSTOOLS with solver SDPT3. It has only been varified to work with SOSTOOLS v 3.03, SDPT3 v 4.0 and MATLAB R2019b.
